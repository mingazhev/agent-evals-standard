# Agent Evals Glossary

- Status: current
- Purpose: shared terminology for the normative, contractual, and operational
  `agent-evals` documentation.

Terms are defined once in this glossary. Other documents may reference these
definitions but must not introduce local definitions with different semantics.

## Terms

- **Case (task or test case)** — one evaluation task with a pinned snapshot,
  task description, setup and validation procedures, scoring rules, risk tier,
  and owner. `Case` is the local contract name for what evaluation literature
  commonly calls a task or test case.
- **Trial** — one isolated attempt by one agent configuration to solve one case.
- **Run** — a set of trials performed against a fixed case-set version with a
  fixed agent configuration.
- **Agent configuration** — the exact model, agent harness, prompts, tool
  access, budgets, safeguards, and other settings under evaluation.
- **Grader** — logic that evaluates one aspect of agent performance. A grader
  may contain multiple assertions or checks and may inspect the transcript, the
  final outcome, or both.
- **Task outcome** — the final state of the environment at the end of a trial,
  as distinct from what the agent merely claims to have done.
- **Primary outcome** — the Scorecard Contract's mutually exclusive trial
  classification derived from task outcome, trajectory, policy evidence, and
  measurement validity. It is broader than the final environment state.
- **Transcript (trace or trajectory)** — the complete record of a trial,
  including model outputs, tool calls, intermediate results, and other
  interactions.
- **Evaluation harness** — the infrastructure that runs evaluations end to end:
  it provides instructions and tools, isolates and executes trials, records
  traces and artifacts, invokes graders, and aggregates results.
- **Agent harness (scaffold)** — the system that turns a model into an agent by
  processing inputs, orchestrating tool use, managing state, and returning
  results. The evaluated agent includes both the model and this harness.
- **Evaluation suite** — a collection of tasks designed to measure related
  capabilities, behaviors, or failure modes.
- **Profile** — the stack- or domain-specific layer that provides bootstrap
  logic, graders, hidden checks, and local engineering rules.
- **Adapter** — the integration layer that invokes a particular agent or agent
  harness without leaking implementation details into the core case model or
  scoring logic.
- **Automated hard gate** — a deterministic acceptance condition whose failure
  makes a result unacceptable regardless of any quality metric or composite
  score.
- **Diagnostic check** — a measurement retained for analysis but absent from
  `scoring.hardGates`. A hard gate cannot be downgraded by labeling its backing
  evidence diagnostic.
- **Backing check** — an automated check that produces typed evidence for a
  specific gate. A process invocation or exit code without a valid result
  envelope is not backing evidence.
- **Control proof** — recorded evidence that a backing check distinguishes the
  expected positive and negative controls and is not vacuous. It is a property
  of the measurement system, not an agent result.
- **Governance gate/status** — an accountable review or approval condition that
  blocks acceptance until explicitly closed through a policy-valid `resolved`
  or `waived` terminal state but is not an automated grader. A determinate
  untriggered condition is `not_applicable`, not pseudo-resolved. It is represented
  by a field orthogonal to the outcome, such as `manual_review_required` or
  `security_review_required`.
- **Composite score** — a summary or triage signal calculated after hard gates;
  it is not an autonomous governance decision.
- **Accepted outcome** — `solved`, `correct_refusal`, or `already_solved` after
  all required automated hard gates pass and no unresolved blocking governance
  status remains.
- **Valid functional outcome** — a successful outcome with `validity: valid`
  and all required automated hard gates passed. It is the conditioning event
  for efficiency analysis. Governance acceptance additionally requires all
  blocking statuses to be closed and may apply pre-registered cost or review
  constraints.
- **Invalid trial/run** — a trial or run whose result cannot be interpreted as
  agent success or failure because a case contract is violated, a required gate
  lacks backing evidence, oracle isolation is compromised, a trigger state is
  indeterminate, or the measurement system is corrupted.
- **Attempt ledger** — a runner-owned, append-only record of every scheduled or
  started attempt, including invalid, interrupted, missing-capture, and
  replacement attempts, with retry lineage and artifact hashes.
- **Measurement trust domain** — runner-owned grader execution, commands,
  manifests, result channels, and artifact capture that agent-controlled code
  cannot modify and that remain distinct from agent-authored evidence.
- **pass@k** — the probability of at least one successful outcome in `k`
  independent attempts.
- **pass^k / reliability@k** — the probability that all `k` independent trials
  succeed; a consistency signal relevant to autonomy decisions. `k`, the
  estimator, reset conditions, and any departure from independence are fixed in
  the statistical plan.
- **Conservative bound** — a pre-registered interval that assigns unresolved or
  invalid observations in the direction least favorable to the claim. The
  default binary and comparative formulas are defined by the Scorecard
  Contract; “valid-only” is not itself a conservative bound.
- **Risk tier** — a pre-assigned level of potential harm and required
  governance that is not changed retroactively after results are observed.
- **Lifecycle state** — a case state: `candidate`, `active`, `saturated`,
  `regression`, `quarantined`, or `retired`.
- **Regression case** — a saturated case moved into a must-pass suite to detect
  regressions rather than measure capability gains.
- **Case QA record** — a case-activation artifact containing evidence for the
  stages in the [Case QA Playbook](case-qa-playbook.md).
- **Canary marker** — a unique string embedded in case artifacts to detect
  leakage beyond the evaluation boundary.
- **Memorization probe** — a check for whether a model or harness reproduces a
  reference solution without repository access.
- **Diff scope** — a grader-owned comparison between the current workspace and
  a trusted base manifest, including additions, modifications, deletions, file
  modes, and every regular-file type. A workspace-owned baseline is not trusted.
- **Approver** — the accountable person authorized by policy to make the stated
  decision and independent of the experiment operator and evidence producer.
- **Risk owner** — the person accountable for residual harm within the approved
  scope and for rollback when a pre-registered condition triggers.
- **Security approver** — the policy-authorized independent approver for a
  security-sensitive decision or closure.
- **False-positive / false-negative owner** — the named owner responsible for
  triage, remediation, and revalidation of the corresponding grader defect.
- **Data owner** — the authority for access, retention, export, rotation, and
  held-out status of case data.
